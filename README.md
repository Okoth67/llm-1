# 🧠 Next Word Prediction with GPT Tokenization

This repository is part of my **LLM Engineering Journey**, where I document hands-on projects every week to build job-ready skills in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models.

## 📁 Project: Next Word Prediction with GPT Tokenization

In this notebook:
- ✅ Explored Hugging Face `datasets` and `transformers`
- ✅ Loaded and preprocessed the AG News dataset
- ✅ Worked through a simple next-word prediction task using GPT tokenization
- ✅ Set up my development environment and GitHub project workflow

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 📚 Purpose
Build the foundations of LLMs by understanding:
- How datasets are loaded and tokenized
- How token-level prediction works
- How to use notebooks for quick prototyping
