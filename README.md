 🧠 LLM Engineering Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document weekly hands-on projects to build job-ready skills in **Natural Language Processing** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

 📂 Projects
1. Next Word Prediction with GPT Tokenization  
**Folder:** `next_word_prediction/`  
In this project, I:  
- Explored Hugging Face `datasets` and `transformers`  
- Loaded and preprocessed the AG News dataset  
- Worked through a simple next-word prediction task using GPT tokenization  
- Set up my development environment and GitHub workflow  

---
2. Saving & Loading GPT Model Weights  
**Folder:** `save_load_gpt/`  
In this project, I:  
- Loaded GPT-2 with Hugging Face Transformers  
- Ran inference on dummy text input  
- Saved model weights using `torch.save(model.state_dict())`  
- Recreated a fresh model instance and loaded saved weights  
- Verified outputs remained identical before and after loading  
- Checkpointed model and optimizer states with PyTorch  

This strengthens understanding of model persistence critical for LLM fine-tuning and sharing.
